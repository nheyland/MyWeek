# MyWeek - Weekly Planner

## Introduction

> Our application is a daily organizer. Users will be able to plan events and input those events into a Django based backend.         

## Code Samples

> Ultimately we will not allow users to schedule two things at one point. 
We will use validations to confirm two events do not overlap. 

> We will also be working with a JS based module to schedule things on the calendar. 

> Lastly Given an address we will use the Mapbox API to show a user where an event is located on a miniature map.
